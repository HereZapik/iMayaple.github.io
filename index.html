    <h2> Who Am I?</h2>
    
<p> My name is Maya and I am a programmer who works with HTML/CSS, & C++ with knowledge of C#, Python, & Game Maker Language. I went to St. Lawrence College for Video Game Development but decided to part ways with the school after one year of education. Since then I have dedicated my time to teaching myself programming languages and improving my problem solving skills.</p>

    <h2> What Do I Do?</h2>
    
    
<p> Well I stated I am a programmer, I primarily work with HTML/CSS but am branching to other languages so that I can do more then coding a website like the one you are on. Currently I can make websites and do simple game based programming along with making discord bots, I would like to be able to program larger scale games and get into making software as well.
